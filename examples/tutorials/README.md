# ManiSkill Tutorials


This folder contains some simple tutorial for how to use ManiSkill, leverage fast vectorized environments, as well as train agents with Reinforcement Learning. These notebooks all designed to run both on Google Colab as well as locally.

Quick-Start + Feature Show Case: https://colab.research.google.com/github/haosulab/ManiSkill/blob/main/examples/tutorials/1_quickstart.ipynb
- Covers all the core features of ManiSkill
- Has some RL examples for training state-based and visual-based policies very quickly

Imitation learning baselines, model-based RL, and other methods are still WIP.
