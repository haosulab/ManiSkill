# ManiSkill Tutorials


This folder contains some simple tutorial for how to use ManiSkill, leverage fast vectorized environments, and train agents with Reinforcement Learning. These notebooks are all designed to run both on Google Colab and locally..

Getting Started and Feature Showcase: [Quickstart Tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/github/haosulab/ManiSkill/blob/main/examples/tutorials/1_quickstart.ipynb)
- Covers all the core features of ManiSkill.
- Includes RL examples for quickly training state-based and visual-based policies.

Imitation learning baselines, model-based RL, and other methods are still works in progress.
