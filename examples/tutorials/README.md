# ManiSkill Tutorials


This folder contains some simple tutorials (notebooks and single-file implementations) for how to use and customize ManiSkill, leverage fast vectorized environments, as well as train agents with Reinforcement Learning and Imitation Learning. These notebooks all designed to run both on Google Colab as well as locally.

Quick-Start + Feature Show Case: https://colab.research.google.com/github/haosulab/ManiSkill/blob/main/examples/tutorials/1_quickstart.ipynb
- Covers all the core features of ManiSkill
- Has some RL examples for training state-based and visual-based policies very quickly
