# ManiSkill2 Tutorials


This folder contains some simple tutorials (notebooks and single-file implementations) for how to use ManiSkill2 and train agents with Reinforcement Learning and Imitation Learning. These notebooks all designed to run both on Google Colab as well as locally.

The learning tutorials use PyTorch and Stable Baselines 3 but ManiSkill2 can easily work with other frameworks as well.
