    """This wrapper will issue a `done` signal if a maximum number of timesteps is exceeded.

    Oftentimes, it is **very** important to distinguish `done` signals that were produced by the
    :class:`TimeLimit` wrapper (truncations) and those that originate from the underlying environment (terminations).
    This can be done by looking at the ``info`` that is returned when `done`-signal was issued.
    The done-signal originates from the time limit (i.e. it signifies a *truncation*) if and only if
    the key `"TimeLimit.truncated"` exists in ``info`` and the corresponding value is ``True``.

    Example:
       >>> from gym.envs.classic_control import CartPoleEnv
       >>> from gym.wrappers import TimeLimit
       >>> env = CartPoleEnv()
       >>> env = TimeLimit(env, max_episode_steps=1000)
