# Stable Baselines 3

The example.py code shows a very simple example of how to use Stable Baselines 3 with ManiSkill 3 via a simple wrapper. These are not tuned as much compared to the [recommended PPO baseline code](https://github.com/haosulab/ManiSkill/tree/main/examples/baselines/ppo) so we cannot guarantee good performance from using Stable Baselines 3. Moreover, currently Stable Baselines 3 is not optimized for GPU vectorized environments, so it will train a bit slower.
