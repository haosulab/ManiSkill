# Diffusion Policy

Code for running the Diffusion Policy algorithm based on ["Diffusion Policy: Visuomotor Policy Learning via Action Diffusion"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04137v4). It is adapted from the [original code](https://github.com/real-stanford/diffusion_policy).

## Installation

To get started, we recommend using conda/mamba to create a new environment and install the dependencies

```bash
conda create -n diffusion-policy-ms python=3.9
conda activate diffusion-policy-ms
pip install -e .
```

## Setup

Read through the [imitation learning setup documentation](https://maniskill.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/learning_from_demos/setup.html) which details everything you need to know regarding running imitation learning baselines in ManiSkill. It includes details on how to download demonstration datasets, preprocess them, evaluate policies fairly for comparison, as well as suggestions to improve performance and avoid bugs.

## Training

We provide scripts to train Diffusion Policy on demonstrations.

Note that some demonstrations are slow (e.g. motion planning or human teleoperated) and can exceed the default max episode steps which can be an issue as imitation learning algorithms learn to solve the task at the same speed the demonstrations solve it. In this case, you can use the `--max-episode-steps` flag to set a higher value so that the policy can solve the task in time. General recommendation is to set `--max-episode-steps` to about 2x the length of the mean demonstrations length you are using for training. We have tuned baselines in the `baselines.sh` script that set a recommended `--max-episode-steps` for each task.

Example state based training, learning from 100 demonstrations generated via motionplanning in the PickCube-v1 task

```bash
seed=1
demos=100
python train.py --env-id PickCube-v1 \
  --demo-path ~/.maniskill/demos/PickCube-v1/motionplanning/trajectory.state.pd_ee_delta_pos.physx_cpu.h5 \
  --control-mode "pd_ee_delta_pos" --sim-backend "physx_cpu" --num-demos ${demos} --max_episode_steps 100 \
  --total_iters 30000 \
  --exp-name diffusion_policy-PickCube-v1-state-${demos}_motionplanning_demos-${seed} \
  --track # track training on wandb
```
