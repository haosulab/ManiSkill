# Diffusion Policy

Code for running the Diffusion Policy algorithm is adapted from [CleanRL](https://github.com/vwxyzjn/cleanrl/). It is written to be single-file and easy to follow/read, and supports state-based RL and visual-based RL code.

## Installation

To get started, we recommend using conda/mamba to create a new environment and install the dependencies

```bash
conda create -n diffusion-policy-ms python=3.9
conda activate diffusion-policy-ms
pip install diffusers
```

Then you can install ManiSkill and its dependencies

```bash
pip install mani_skill torch==2.3.1
```
