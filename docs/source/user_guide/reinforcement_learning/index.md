# Reinforcement Learning

ManiSkill supports all kinds of reinforcement learning methods via a unified API and provides multiple ready, already tested, baselines for use/comparison. The pages below show how to [setup environments for reinforcement learning](./setup.md) and how to use the [RL baselines](./baselines.md). All baseline results are published to our [public wandb page](https://wandb.ai/stonet2000/ManiSkill). On that page you can filter by algorithm used, environment type, etc. We are still in the progress of running all experiments so not all results are uploaded yet.
