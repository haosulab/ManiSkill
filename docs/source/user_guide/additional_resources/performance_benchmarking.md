# Performance Benchmarking

This page documents code and results of benchmarking various robotics simulators on a number of dimensions. It is still a WIP as we write more fair benchmarking environments for other simulators. Given the number of factors that impact simulation speed and rendering (e.g number of objects, geometry complexity etc.) trends that appear in results in this page may not necesarily be the case on some environments.

Currently we just compare ManiSkill and [Isaac Lab](https://github.com/isaac-sim/IsaacLab) on one task, Cartpole Balancing (control). For details on benchmarking methodology see [this section](#benchmarking-detailsmethodology)

Raw benchmark results can be read from the .csv files in the [results folder on GitHub](https://github.com/haosulab/ManiSkill/blob/main/docs/source/user_guide/additional_resources/benchmarking_results). There are also plotted figures in that folder. Below we show a selection of some of the figures/results from testing on a RTX 4090. The figures are also sometimes annotated with the GPU memory usage in GB. 

Overall, ManiSkill is faster than Isaac Lab on the majority of settings and is much more GPU memory efficient, especially for realistic camera setups. GPU memory efficiency is particularly important for machine learning methods like RL which rely on large replay buffers on the GPU. However we note that this is not a pure apples-to-apples comparison due to differences in rendering techniques and so we show a qualitative comparison of the same task in Isaac Lab and ManiSkill. See the note below for more details.

:::{dropdown} Note on rendering differences between simulators

We acknowledge that these comparisons are not strictly apples-to-apples due to differences in rendering techniques. Isaac Lab employs ray-tracing for parallel rendering, while the ManiSkill3 results are generated using SAPIEN’s rasterization renderer (see image below for a qualitative comparison), although
ManiSkill3 also supports a ray-tracing mode without parallelization. Ray-tracing generally offers
greater flexibility in balancing rendering speed and quality through the adjustment of parameters
such as samples per pixel. It’s worth noting that the Isaac Lab data presented here uses the fastest
rendering settings available in Isaac Lab v1.2.0, although it can be easily tuned to achieve better rendering quality that may be
helpful for sim2real. Despite the use of different rendering techniques, we believe this experiment
provides a meaningful basis for comparison.

### Realistic RGB Camera Setups

The [Open-X](https://robotics-transformer-x.github.io/) and [Droid](https://droid-dataset.github.io/) datasets are two of the largest real-world robotics datasets. Open-X typically has a single 640x480 RGB observation while Droid has 3 320x180 RGB observations. The next 2 figures show the performance of simulators when mimicing the real world camera setups.

## Benchmarking Details/Methodology

There is currently one benchmarked task: Cartpole Balance (classic control). Details about the exact configurations of the two tasks are detailed in the [next section](#task-configuration).

For simulators that use physx (like ManiSkill and Isaac Lab), for comparison we try to align as many simulation configuration parameters (like number of solver position iterations) as well as object types (e.g. collision meshes, size of objects etc.) as close as possible.

In the future we plan to benchmark other simulators using other physics engines (like Mujoco) although how to fairly do so is still WIP.

Reward functions and evaluation functions are purposely left out and not benchmarked.

Due to varying implementations of parallel rendering mechanisms, to benchmark the FPS when generating RGB, Depth, and/or Segmentation observations, we plot figures showing the FPS ablating on the number of parallel environments, image size, and number of cameras. Within each evaluation, we try and pick configurations that maximize the FPS when given fixed # of environments, # of cameras per environment, and/or image size.
