# Reinforcement Learning (WIP)

We provide a number of different baselines that learn from rewards. For RL baselines that leverage demonstrations see the [learning from demos section](../learning_from_demos/)

As part of these baselines we establish a few reinforcement learning benchmarks that cover a wide range of difficulties (easy to solve for verification but not saturated) and diversity in types of robotics task, including but not limited to classic control, dextrous manipulation, table-top manipulation, mobile manipulation etc.
