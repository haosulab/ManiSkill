# Workflows

We provide a number of tuned baselines/workflows for robot learning and training autonomous policies to solve robotics tasks. These span learning from demonstrations/imitation learning and reinforcement learning.

This is still a WIP but we plan to upload as many pretrained checkpoints, training curves, etc. for all solvable tasks (some need much more advanced techniques to solve) online for people to research and compare with.
