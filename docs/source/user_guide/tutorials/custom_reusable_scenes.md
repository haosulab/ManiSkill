# Custom Reusable Scenes

In the [custom tasks tutorial](./custom_environments.md) and the example [push_cube.py](mani_skill2/envs/tasks/pick_cube.py) code you may have noticed that they create a `TableSceneBuilder` object to load and initialize. These are classes that inherit the `SceneBuilder` class, which defines a simple few APIs necessary for building and initializing a scene in an task and allow you to easily re-use the scene you make across multiple tasks.
