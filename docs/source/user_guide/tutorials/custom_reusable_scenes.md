# Custom Reusable Scenes

WIP

<!-- In the [custom tasks tutorial](./custom_environments.md) and the example [push_cube.py](mani_skill/envs/tasks/pick_cube.py) code you may have noticed that they create a `TableSceneBuilder` object to load the scene's objects and initialize those objects as well as some robots to initial poses. These are classes that inherit the `SceneBuilder` class, which defines a simple few APIs necessary for building and initializing a scene in an task and allow you to easily re-use the scene you make across multiple tasks. It is not absolutely necessary to have to inherit `SceneBuilder` but if used then your custom scene can easily be re-used for existing tasks in ManiSkill that allow randomizing/sampling the scene (e.g. mobile manipulation pick/place/open/close tasks sample random scenes and configurations) -->
