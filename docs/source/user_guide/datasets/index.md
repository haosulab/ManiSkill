# {octicon}`database` Datasets

Pages here document how to download various datasets and use them.

There is also documentation on how to work with ManiSkill generated trajectories (typically generated via the `RecordEpisode` wrapper), including how they are formatted and how to replay them. For details on how to collect data in the first place check out the [data collection section](../data_collection/index.md)
