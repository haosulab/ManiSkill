# Motion Planning

ManiSkill provides simple tools to use motion planning to generate robot trajectories, primarily via the open-source [mplib](https://github.com/haosulab/MPlib) library. If you install ManiSkill, mplib will come installed already so no extra installation is necessary.

For an in depth tutorial on how to use more advanced features of mplib check out their documentation here: https://motion-planning-lib.readthedocs.io/latest/. Otherwise this section will cover some example code you can use and modify to generate motion planned demonstrations. The example code here is written for the Panda arm but should be modifiable to work for other robots.
