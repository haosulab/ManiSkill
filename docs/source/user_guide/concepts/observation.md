# Observation

## Observation mode

**The observation mode defines the observation space.**
All ManiSkill tasks take the observation mode (`obs_mode`) as one of the input arguments of `__init__`.
In general, the observation is organized as a dictionary (with an observation space of `gym.spaces.Dict`).

There are two raw observations modes: `state_dict` (privileged states) and `sensor_data` (raw sensor data like visual data without postprocessing). `state` is a flat version of `state_dict`. `rgb+depth`, `rgb+depth+segmentation` (or any combination of `rgb`, `depth`, `segmentation`), and `pointcloud` apply post-processing on `sensor_data` to give convenient representations of visual data.

The details here show the unbatched shapes. In general there is always a batch dimension unless you are using CPU simulation. Moreover, we annotate what dtype some values are, where some have both a torch and numpy dtype depending on whether you are using GPU or CPU simulation repspectively.

### state_dict

The observation is a dictionary of states. It usually contains privileged information such as object poses. It is not supported for soft-body tasks.

- `agent`: robot proprioception (return value of a task's `_get_obs_agent` function)
  - `qpos`: [nq], current joint positions. *nq* is the degree of freedom.
  - `qvel`: [nq], current joint velocities
  <!-- - `base_pose`: [7], robot position (xyz) and quaternion (wxyz) in the world frame -->
  - `controller`: controller states depending on the used controller. Usually an empty dict.
- `extra`: a dictionary of task-specific information, e.g., goal position, end-effector position. This is the return value of a task's `_get_obs_extra` function

### state

It is a flat version of *state_dict*. The observation space is `gym.spaces.Box`.

### sensor_data

In addition to `agent` and `extra`, `sensor_data` and `sensor_param` are introduced. At the moment there are only Camera type sensors. Cameras are special in that they can be run with different choices of shaders. The default shader is called `minimal` which is the fastest and most memory efficient option. The shader chosen determines what data is stored in this observation mode. We describe the raw data format for the `minimal` shader here. Detailed information on how sensors/cameras can be customized can be found in the [sensors](../tutorials/sensors/index.md) section.

- `sensor_data`: data captured by sensors configured in the environment
  - `{sensor_uid}`:
    
    If the data comes from a camera sensor:
    - `Color`: [H, W, 4], `torch.uint8`. RGB+Alpha values..
    - `PositionSegmentation`: [H, W, 4], `torch.int16`. The first 3 dimensions stand for (x, y, z) coordinates in the OpenGL/Blender convension. The unit is millimeters. The last dimension represents segmentation ID, see the [Segmentation data section](#segmentation-data) for more details.

- `sensor_param`: parameters of each sensor, which varies depending on type of sensor
  - `{sensor_uid}`:

    If `sensor_uid` corresponds to a camera:
    - `cam2world_gl`: [4, 4], transformation from the camera frame to the world frame (OpenGL/Blender convention)
    - `extrinsic_cv`: [4, 4], camera extrinsic (OpenCV convention)
    - `intrinsic_cv`: [3, 3], camera intrinsic (OpenCV convention)

### rgb+depth+segmentation

This observation mode has the same data format as the [sensor_data mode](#sensor_data), but all sensor data from cameras are replaced with the following structure

- `sensor_data`:
  - `{sensor_uid}`:

    If the data comes from a camera sensor:
    - `rgb`: [H, W, 3], `torch.uint8, np.uint8`. RGB.
    - `depth`: [H, W, 1], `torch.int16, np.uint16`. The unit is millimeters. 0 stands for an invalid pixel (beyond the camera far).
    - `segmentation`: [H, W, 1], `torch.int16, np.uint16`. See the [Segmentation data section](#segmentation-data) for more details.

Note that this data is not scaled/normalized to [0, 1] or [-1, 1] in order to conserve memory, so if you consider to train on RGB, depth, and/or segmentation data be sure to scale your data before training on it.


ManiSkill by default flexibly supports different combinations of RGB, depth, and segmentation data, namely `rgb`, `depth`, `segmentation`, `rgb+depth`, `rgb+depth+segmentation`, `rgb+segmentation`, and`depth+segmentation`. (`rgbd` is a short hand for `rgb+depth`). Whichever image modality that is not chosen will not be included in the observation and conserves some memory and GPU bandwith.

The RGB and depth data visualized can look like below:

### pointcloud
This observation mode has the same data format as the [sensor_data mode](#sensor_data), but all sensor data from cameras are removed and instead a new key is added called `pointcloud`.

- `pointcloud`:
  - `xyzw`: [N, 4], `torch.float32, np.float32`. Point cloud fused from all cameras in the world frame. "xyzw" is a homogeneous representation. `w=0` for infinite points (beyond the camera far), and `w=1` for the rest.
  - `rgb`: [N, 3], `torch.uint8, np.uint8`. corresponding colors of the fused point cloud
  - `segmentation`: [N, 1], `torch.int16, np.uint16`. See the [Segmentation data section](#segmentation-data) for more details.
Note that the point cloud does not contain more information than RGB-D images unless specified otherwise.

The pointcloud visualized can look like below. Below is the fused pointcloud of two cameras in the ReplicaCAD scene

```

For a quick demo to visualize pointclouds, you can run

```bash
python -m mani_skill.examples.demo_vis_pcd -e "PushCube-v1"
```

## Segmentation Data

Objects upon being loaded are automatically assigned a segmentation ID (the `per_scene_id` attribute of `sapien.Entity` objects). To get information about which IDs refer to which Actors / Links, you can run the code below

```python
import gymnasium as gym
import mani_skill.envs
from mani_skill.utils.structs import Actor, Link
env = gym.make("PushCube-v1", obs_mode="rgbd")
for obj_id, obj in sorted(env.unwrapped.segmentation_id_map.items()):
    if isinstance(obj, Actor):
        print(f"{obj_id}: Actor, name - {obj.name}")
    elif isinstance(obj, Link):
        print(f"{obj_id}: Link, name - {obj.name}")
```

Note that ID 0 refers to the distant background. For a quick demo of this, you can run

```bash
python -m mani_skill.examples.demo_vis_segmentation -e "PushCube-v1" # plot all segmentations
python -m mani_skill.examples.demo_vis_segmentation -e "PushCube-v1" --id cube # mask everything but the object with name "cube" 
```
