# Controllers / Action Spaces

Controllers are interfaces between policies and robots. The policy outputs actions to the controller, and the controller converts actions to control signals to the robot. For example, the `arm_pd_ee_delta_pose` controller takes the relative movement of the end-effector as input, and uses [inverse kinematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_kinematics) to convert input actions to target positions of robot joints. The robot uses a [PD controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller) to drive motors to achieve target joint positions.

**The controller defines the action space of an task.** The robot can have separate controllers for its arm, gripper, and other components. The action space is a concatenation of the action spaces of all controllers.

Note that while `pd_ee_delta_pose` type controllers that use IK may be more sample efficient to train / learn from for RL workflows, in GPU simulation running these controllers is not that fast and may slow down RL training.

## Terminology

- fixed joint: a joint that can not be controlled. The degree of freedom (DoF) is 0.
- `qpos` ( $q$ ): controllable joint positions
- `qvel` ( $\dot{q}$ ): controllable joint velocities
- target joint position ( $\bar{q}$ ): target position of the motor which drives the joint
- target joint velocity ( $\bar{\dot{q}}$ ): target velocity of the motor which drives the joint
- PD controller: control loop based on $F(t) = K_p (\bar{q}(t) - q(t)) + K_d (\bar{\dot{q}}(t) - \dot{q}(t))$. $K_p$ (stiffness) and $K_d$ (damping) are hyperparameters. $F(t)$ is the force of the motor.
- Augmented PD controller: Passive forces (like gravity) are compensated for the PD controller.
- action ( $a$ ): the input of the controller, also the output of the policy

## Supported Controllers (Franka Emika)

The robot is [Franka Emika](https://github.com/frankaemika/franka_ros), a.k.a Panda. The DoF of the arm is 7. **We use the tool center point (TCP), which is the center between two fingers, as the end-effector.**

All "pd" controllers translate input actions to target joint positions $\bar{q}$ (and velocities) for the internal built-in PD controller. **All the controllers have a normalized action space ([-1, 1]), except `arm_pd_joint_pos` and `arm_pd_joint_pos_vel`.**

For simplicity, we use the name of the arm controller to represent each combination of the arm and gripper controllers, since there is only one gripper controller currently. For example, `pd_joint_delta_pos` is short for `arm_pd_joint_delta_pos` + `gripper_pd_joint_pos`.

### Arm controllers

- arm_pd_joint_pos (7-dim): The input is $\bar{q}$. It can be used for motion planning, but note that the target velocity is always 0.
- arm_pd_joint_delta_pos (7-dim):  $\bar{q}(t)=q(t) + a$
- arm_pd_joint_target_delta_pos (7-dim): $\bar{q}(t)=\bar{q}(t-1) + a$
- arm_pd_ee_delta_pos (3-dim): only control position ( $p$ ) without rotation ( $R$ ).
  
  $\bar{p}(t)=p(t)+a$, $\bar{R}(t)=R(t)$, $\bar{q}(t)=IK(\bar{p}(t), \bar{R}(t))$

- arm_pd_ee_delta_pose (6-dim): both position ( $p$ ) and rotation ( $R$ ) are controlled. Rotation is represented as axis-angle in the end-effector frame.

  $\bar{p}(t)=p(t)+a_{p}$, $\bar{R}(t)=R(t) \cdot e^{[a_{R}]_{\times}}$, $\bar{q}(t)=IK(\bar{p}(t), \bar{R}(t))$

- arm_pd_ee_target_delta_pos (3-dim): $\bar{p}(t)=\bar{p}(t-1)+a$, $\bar{R}(t)=R(t)$
- arm_pd_ee_target_delta_pose (6-dim): $\bar{T}(t)= T_{a} \cdot \bar{T}(t-1)$. $T$ is the transformation of the end-effector. $T_a$ is the delta pose induced by the action.
- arm_pd_joint_vel (7-dim): only control target joint velocities. Note that the stiffness $K_p$ is set to 0.
- arm_pd_joint_pos_vel (14-dim): the extension of `arm_pd_joint_pos` to support target velocities
- arm_pd_joint_delta_pos_vel (14-dim): the extension of `arm_pd_joint_delta_pos` to support target velocities

### Gripper controllers (optional)

- gripper_pd_joint_pos (1-dim): Note that we force two gripper fingers to have the same target position. Thus, it is like a "mimic" joint.

<!-- ## Mobile Manipulator

The mobile manipulator is a combination of sciurus17 connector and one or two Panda arms. The controller is named `base_{}_arm_{}`. Except for the base controller, the arm and gripper controllers are the same as in the stationary manipulator.

### Base controllers

- base_pd_joint_vel (4-dim): only control target velocities. The first 2 dimensions stand for egocentric xy-plane linear velocity and the 3rd dimension stands for egocentric z-axis angular velocity. The 4th dimension stands for velocity to adjust torso. -->
