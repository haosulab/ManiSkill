# Baselines

We provide a number of different baselines spanning different categories of learning from demonstrations research: Behavior Cloning / Supervised Learning, Offline Reinforcement Learning, and Online Learning from Demonstrations. This page is still a WIP as we finish running experiments and establish clear baselines and benchmarking setups.

<!-- As part of these baselines we establish a few standard learning from demonstration benchmarks that cover a wide range of difficulty (easy to solve for verification but not saturated) and diversity in types of demonstrations (human collected, motion planning collected, neural net policy generated) -->

**Behavior Cloning (BC) Baselines**

BC Baselines are characterized by supervised learning focused algorithms for learning from demonstrations, without any online interaction with the environment.

| Baseline                       | Code                                                                                        | Results | Paper                                      |

**Online Learning from Demonstrations Baselines**

Online ;earning from demonstrations baselines are characterized by learning from demonstrations while also leveraging online environment interactions.
