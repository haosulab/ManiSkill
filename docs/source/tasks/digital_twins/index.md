# Digital Twins

ManiSkill supports both training and evaluation types of digital twins and provides a simple framework for building them. Training digital twins are tasks designed to train a robot in simulation to then be deployed in the real world (sim2real). Evaluation digital twins are tasks designed to evaluate the performance of a robot trained on real world data (real2sim) and not for training.


## Training Digital Twins (WIP)

## Evaluation Digital Twins

We currently support evaluation digital twins of some tasks in the [BridgeData v2](https://rail-berkeley.github.io/bridgedata/) environments in simulation based on https://simpler-env.github.io/ by Xuanlin Li, Kyle Hsu, Jiayuan Gu et. al.
