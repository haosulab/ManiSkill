# Drawing Tasks

ManiSkill has example environments that simulate "drawing" with a robot. Currently there are no reward functions / success conditions, just base environments to play around with and extend for your own use cases.

## TableTopFreeDraw-v1

Instantiates a table with a white canvas on it and a robot with a stick that draws red lines.
