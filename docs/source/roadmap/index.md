# Roadmap

We are constantly working to improve ManiSkill in all aspects, from simulation/rendering speed to usability. Below is a brief list of planned upcoming features that will come to ManiSkill in the future

- More offline RL Baselines (Algorithms like IQL, CQL, etc.)
- A new, fast and accurate soft body simulator
- Simple beautification tools to make high quality renders/recordings of trajectories in simulation
- Object database of high quality, simulation ready assets (rigid-body, soft-body, articulations) for use in your tasks
- More sensor types like Lidar
