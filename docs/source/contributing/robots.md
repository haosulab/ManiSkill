# Robots

To add a new robot, you can follow any of the existing robots built already as templates in ManiSkill. We also highly recommend that you read through the [custom robot tutorial](../user_guide/tutorials/custom_robots.md) to learn how to make new robots and tune them.

ManiSkill is a supporter of open-source and we encourage you to make contributions to help grow our [list of robots](../robots) in simulation!

## Contributing the Robot to ManiSkill

We recommend first opening an issue on our GitHub about your interest in adding a new robot as to not conflict with others and to consolidate information. Once done, our maintainers can give a go ahead.

In your pull request, we ask you to do the following:
- The robot / agent class code should be placed in `mani_skill/agents/<agent_group_name>/your_robot.py`. If you want to re-use an agent class (e.g. as done with the Allegro hand robot and the Panda robot) you can create a folder that groups all the different agent classes together.
- Update `mani_skill/utils/download_asset.py` and add a data source linking to your new robot under the `initialize_extra_resources` function. We recommend you to comment on the issue you opened with the asset files so we can then create a repository for it that is versioned. You can also create a repository yourself, you can follow how https://github.com/haosulab/ManiSkill-ANYmalC/ is setup to do this. The easiest way to allow access to assets is to create a Github release and link the source code zip file in the `download_asset.py` code
- Finally document the new robot! Add an appropriate section to `docs/source/robots` and follow the template of the other robots there.

For some robot types we ask for additional verifications, currently of which we only ask for details for manipulation robots.

### Testing Manipulation Robots

For any robot that is meant to be able to manipulate objects, we ask you to verify the robot can solve the [`PickCube-v1`](../tasks/table_top_gripper/index.md#pickcube-v1) task successfully via training with GPU simulation and RL (The PPO algorithm specifically). The PickCube-v1 task is a simple task where the robot learns to pick up a cube from a table and bring it to a green goal location. You will need to update the [PickCube-v1 configs](https://github.com/haosulab/ManiSkill/blob/main/mani_skill/envs/tasks/tabletop/pick_cube_cfgs.py) to make the task solvable with the new robot. The existing code shows examples of how they are already benchmarked for the Franka Emika robot, XArm6+Robotiq gripper Robot, and SO100 robot arm.
