# Motion Planning

ManiSkill provides simple tools to use motion planning to generate robot trajectories, primarily via the open-source [mplib](https://github.com/haosulab/MPlib) library. If you install ManiSkill, mplib will come installed already so no extra installation is necessary.

For an in depth tutorial on how to use more advanced features of mplib check out their documentation here: TODO (stao)
