# ManiSkill

ManiSkill is a feature-rich GPU-accelerated robotics benchmark built on top of [SAPIEN](https://github.com/haosulab/sapien) designed to provide accessible support for a wide array of applications from robot learning, learning from demonstrations, sim2real/real2sim, and more. 

Features:

* GPU parallelized simulation enabling 200,000+ FPS on some tasks
* GPU parallelized rendering enabling 10,000+ FPS on some tasks, massively outperforming other benchmarks
* Flexible API to build custom tasks of any complexity
* Variety of verified robotics tasks with diverse dynamics and visuals
* Reproducible baselines in Reinforcement Learning and Learning from Demonstrations, spread across tasks from dextrous manipulation to mobile manipulation
