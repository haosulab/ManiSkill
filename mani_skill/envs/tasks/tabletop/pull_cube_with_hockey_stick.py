"""
Code for a minimal environment/task with just a robot being loaded. We recommend copying this template and modifying as you need.

At a high-level, ManiSkill tasks can minimally be defined by how the environment resets, what agents/objects are
loaded, goal parameterization, and success conditions

Environment reset is comprised of running two functions, `self._reconfigure` and `self.initialize_episode`, which is auto
run by ManiSkill. As a user, you can override a number of functions that affect reconfiguration and episode initialization.

Reconfiguration will reset the entire environment scene and allow you to load/swap assets and agents.

Episode initialization will reset the positions of all objects (called actors), articulations, and agents,
in addition to initializing any task relevant data like a goal

See comments for how to make your own environment and what each required function should do
