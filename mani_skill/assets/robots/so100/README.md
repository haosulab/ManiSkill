# SO100

This is the 6DOF SO100 arm. The original assets are from [here](https://github.com/TheRobotStudio/SO-ARM100) and were provided under a [Apache 2.0 License](LICENSE)

Changes made:
- Fixed joint limits to reflect real world behavior
- Fixed joint tags from continuous to revolute which permit joint limits
- Fixed joint directions to match the real robot's joint directions
- Fixed orientations of Upper_Arm.STL to match the real world when joint angles are all 0.
