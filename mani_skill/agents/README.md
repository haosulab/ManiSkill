# Robots/Agents

The robots defined in the robots folder are for general use in any task that says that robot is supported. 

Note that some tasks like CartPole have a "robot" that is defined just for that task and thus do not have their robot class placed here.

## How to create a new robot

We recommend copying the files in `mani_skill/robots/_template` and starting from there.
