ManiSkill is a powerful unified framework for robot simulation and training powered by [SAPIEN](https://sapien.ucsd.edu/). The entire stack is as open-source as possible and ManiSkill v3 is in beta release now. Among its features include:
- GPU parallelized visual data collection system. On the high end you can collect RGBD + Segmentation data at 20k FPS with a 4090 GPU, 10-100x faster compared to most other simulators.
- Example tasks covering a wide range of different robot embodiments (quadruped, mobile manipulators, single-arm robots) as well as a wide range of different tasks (table-top, locomotion, dextrous manipulation)
- GPU parallelized tasks, enabling incredibly fast synthetic data collection in simulation
- GPU parallelized tasks support simulating diverse scenes where every parallel environment has a completely different scene/set of objects
- Flexible task building API that abstracts away much of the complex GPU memory management code
<!-- - Evaluate models trained on real-world data in simulation, no robot hardware needed -->

ManiSkill plans to enable all kinds of workflows, including but not limited to 2D/3D vision-based reinforcement learning, imitation learning, sense-plan-act, etc. There will also be more assets/scenes supported by ManiSkill (e.g. [AI2THOR](https://ai2thor.allenai.org/)) in addition to other features such as [digital-twins for evaluation of real-world policies](https://github.com/simpler-env/SimplerEnv), see [our roadmap](https://maniskill.readthedocs.io/en/latest/roadmap/index.html) for planned features that will be added over time before the official v3 is released.

Please refer to our [documentation](https://maniskill.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide) to learn more information from tutorials on building tasks to data collection.

**NOTE:**
This project currently is in a **beta release**, so not all features have been added in yet and there may be some bugs. If you find any bugs or have any feature requests please post them to our [GitHub issues](https://github.com/haosulab/ManiSkill/issues/) or discuss about them on [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/haosulab/ManiSkill/discussions/). We also have a [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/x8yUZe5AdN) through which we make announcements and discuss about ManiSkill.

Users looking for the original ManiSkill2 can find the commit for that codebase at the [v0.5.3 tag](https://github.com/haosulab/ManiSkill/tree/v0.5.3)


## Installation
Installation of ManiSkill is extremely simple, you only need to run a few pip installs

```bash
# install the package
pip install --upgrade mani_skill
# install a version of torch that is compatible with your system
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
```

Finally you also need to set up Vulkan with [instructions here](https://maniskill.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/getting_started/installation.html#vulkan)

For more details about installation (e.g. from source, or doing troubleshooting) see [the documentation](https://maniskill.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/getting_started/installation.html
)

## Getting Started

To get started, check out the quick start documentation: https://maniskill.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/getting_started/quickstart.html

We also have a quick start [colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/haosulab/ManiSkill/blob/main/examples/tutorials/1_quickstart.ipynb) that lets you try out GPU parallelized simulation without needing your own hardware. Everything is runnable on Colab free tier.

For a full list of example scripts you can run see [the docs](https://maniskill.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/demos/index.html).
